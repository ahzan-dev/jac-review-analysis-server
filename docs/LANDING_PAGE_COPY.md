## 2. PROBLEM/SOLUTION SECTION

### Section Headline
"The Review Analysis Problem"

### Problem Statement
```
You're sitting on a goldmine of customer insights—but it's buried under hundreds
of Google Maps reviews.

Reading through them all? That takes hours. Making sense of patterns? Even harder.
Knowing what to actually fix? Nearly impossible without structure.

Most businesses waste time on low-impact improvements while missing the feedback
that could transform their bottom line.
```

### Problem Bullets
- "You spend hours reading reviews looking for patterns"
- "You miss critical feedback hidden in negative reviews"
- "You can't prioritize improvements—all complaints feel equally urgent"
- "You respond reactively instead of strategically"
- "You have no way to track if customer sentiment is improving"

### Solution Section Headline
"Meet Review Analyzer: AI That Understands Your Business"

### Solution Overview
```
Review Analyzer uses a specialized 5-stage AI pipeline to analyze your reviews
like a team of expert consultants would—but in under 2 minutes instead of hours.

It doesn't just summarize feedback. It reveals patterns, identifies opportunities,
and tells you exactly what to fix first—with evidence from real customer quotes.
```

### Core Benefits
```
Get a complete picture of your business health through customer eyes:
- What customers love (your actual competitive advantages)
- What's frustrating them (blind spots you need to address)
